# pdf-generator
This app uses node and the GitHub API to pull your GH information and place it onto a PDF.

The app uses a feedback object to gather the appropriately labeled inputs from GitHub's API, downloads them, then is created into a PDF.

The CSS is premade, but I will be sure to work on this to create another prompt that will push the desired color schemes onto the PDF.

I had previously worked on nodejs in a previous assignment, due to a misinterpretation of the homework title. I have included the link to the repo here: https://github.com/bialoorlem/portfolio/tree/master/assets/js
